## Project Structure

### Initial Data Analysis
The project begins with an exploratory **data analysis** conducted on two datasets
1. Understand the structure and quality of the data.
2. Identify patterns and trends that inform the subsequent machine learning models.

---

### Sentiment Analysis 
This module determines the sentiment of the user based on their ticket. By classifying tickets into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments, the system:
- Prioritizes tickets requiring immediate attention.
- Provides insights into the overall customer satisfaction levels.

Key steps:
1. Preprocessing ticket data.
2. Training and testing a sentiment classification model.

---

### Issue Escalation
This module identifies tickets requiring escalation based on specific keywords and patterns. If an issue is marked for escalation:
- The ticket is forwarded to a human agent for review.
- Automated responses are bypassed to ensure personalized handling.

Key steps:
1. Keyword-based filtering and rule-based classification.
2. Forwarding flagged tickets for manual intervention.

---

### Response Automation
This module generates automated responses for tickets using:

1. **Classical Machine Learning and Transformer-based Classification**:
   - Products are classified based on ticket content.
   - Predefined templates generate responses tailored to the classified product category.

---

### Integration with FastAPI and Zapier
The entire system is integrated using FastAPI to expose API endpoints for each module. These endpoints are connected through Zapier to:
- Automate workflows and email responses.
- Seamlessly handle escalations and response generation.

This integration ensures:
- Scalability of the system.
- A unified platform for executing all functionalities.
